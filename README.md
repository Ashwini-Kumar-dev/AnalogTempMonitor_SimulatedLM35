# AnalogTempMonitor_SimulatedLM35
Simulated LM35 monitor using Arduino UNO and potentiometer in SimulIDE. Converts analog input to Â°C and displays via Serial Monitor or LCD. Built during first semester to explore analog interfacing, temperature scaling, and simulation-first prototyping. The LM35 will be used in future versions instead of the potentiometer.
