1) Search for "UNO" and drag the Arduino UNO board into the workspace.

2) Search for "Potentiometer" and place it near the Arduino.

   Connections:
   - Left Pin   → GND (for ground reference)
   - Middle Pin → A0 or A1 (connect to any analog pin for signal input)
   - Right Pin  → 5V (for power supply)

3) Search for "LCD" and drag the 16x2 LCD component into the workspace.

4) Click on the LCD to open its settings.

5) Select "Attach" to connect the LCD to the Arduino pins.

Explanation:
------------
The middle pin of the potentiometer outputs a variable voltage between 0V and 5V depending on the knob position.
Arduino reads this voltage using analogRead(A0), converting it to a digital value between 0 and 1023.
This value can be displayed on the LCD or used to control other outputs like LEDs, buzzers, or motors.
